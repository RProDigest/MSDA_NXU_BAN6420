Overview

The project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of clothing items. The goal is to accurately categorize these images into one of ten classes, demonstrating the practicality of CNN in image classification.



## FashionMNIST

The Fashion MNIST dataset provides an alternative to the MNIST handwriting dataset. MNIST, which stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, features hand-drawn numbers. In contrast, Fashion MNIST utilizes small images of various clothing items labeled with ten categories. Although Fashion MNIST is unrelated to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, it is still known as "MNIST" due to its recognition for image processing.
## Project Structure

- Notebook File: The main Jupyter Notebook contains all the code necessary for loading the data, preprocessing, building the CNN model, training, evaluating, and visualizing the results.

- README File: This document provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and an explanation of the results.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.12.1 or higher
- keras
- tensorflow
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


## Run the code

- Once you have installed all the necessary libraries and loaded them, you can run the code 

## How to run the notebook

Ensure you have Python on your system. Run the Jupyter notebook cells in sequence from top to bottom. If you skip any cell, you could encounter an error.
